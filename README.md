# The-Production-House

This minimal, unique website was my first freelance gig. My client had an idea for a portfolio, and wanted to see what it looked like in action. This website is not yet online, however feel free to clone and run it locally.

The premise behind this website is that many websites try to give the user what they're looking for immediately, or they flood the user with information that may or may not be relevent to what the user needs. In a context where you want the user to "earn" the value of the website, you would not want this to be the case. Therefore, this website was made with the requirement that the user explore and fiddle with things to see what its all about. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary draft of the website, and that the final product will have a lot more fun things to fiddle with when the time comes to implement all of that. In the mean time, this serves as a basis for the idea stated above.
